## Features

### Burning Skeletons Shoot Burning Arrows

### If a skeleton is on fire it will have a chance to shoot a flaming arrow. Flaming arrows will cause some burning damage if they hit you. (70% chance by default)

### Flint and Steel Deals Burn Damage

### Attacking a mob with flint and steel will cause a small amount of burn damage to the mob. This will cause a bit of durability damage to the item like with any other weapon. (3 fire damage by default)

### Fire Resistance Extinguishes Fire

### This feature will cause the player's burn timer to be cleared while they have a fire resistance potion active. This fixes an annoying issue where the burn timer would increase even if you have a fire resistance potion active. For example swimming in lava would still increase your burn timer regardless of the potion, leading to the fire animation playing for a long time after leaving the lava.

### Fix Fire Damage Not Always Giving Cooked Drops
